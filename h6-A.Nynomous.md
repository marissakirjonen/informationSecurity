The Onion Router, Tor, is an Internet browser modified from the Firefox browser. The user‚Äôs IP address is hidden when within Tor, making it nearly impossible to identify the user. Tor allows access to otherwise government blocked websites, and secure and private communications between parties. Because of the anonymity aspect, Tor can be used for crime. Initially developed by the US government, nowadays Tor allows for improvements by anyone most typically technically skilled activists wanting to improve the site and is not controlled by anyone, especially not the US government. 

In onion routing, the connection moves through multiple servers. The messages and responses received are encrypted with different keys. Each server has its own unique key for encryption. 

How it works: Let‚Äôs say this message will go through three nodes. The first server, node 1, has the address of node 2 and key 1. Node 1 decrypts message using key 1, because it doesn‚Äôt have all the keys, node 1 cannot read the encrypted file, so it sends it to node 2. Node 2 has key 2 and the addresses of node 1 (input node) and node 3 (exit node). Node 2 decrypts the message using key 2, it‚Äôs still encrypted, so it sends it to node 3, the exit node. Node 3 decrypts the message using key 3, which is the ‚Äúlast layer of the onion‚Äù, and the message is passed on to the destination server. The response goes through the same process but adding layers of encryption instead. Essentially throughout the process of going through each node, one layer of encryption is removed (or added), therefore one layer of the onion is peeled (or added back). The core of the onion, the message, is not revealed until the end, which is why nodes cannot see the actual message. 

Mistakes made by users on Tor are the reasons why they are discovered. Settings of the browser should not be changed, as this can result in an accidental leak. A few examples include, allowing location sharing, installing plugins, and allowing scripts and java to run on the browser.

## Installing Tor

The first step for installing Tor, was to install the Browser Bundle off [Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/download/). I installed the Linux version on my VM.

![N√§ytt√∂kuva 2023-09-29 170326](https://github.com/marissakirjonen/informationSecurity/assets/142782994/e5bffa48-3bee-43f5-b6b8-7447e932065c)


After a successful installation, find the bundle in your files and extract the files.

After extraction, the browser file will appear, which you need to click to find the browser.

Now you can start the browser!

That's it, installation is completed. Click connect to connect to the Tor browser.

## Browse Tor

The search engine I used was ahmia.fi. I used the hidden wiki page to find different links to onion sites.
